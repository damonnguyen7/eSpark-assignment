# eSpark Learning Programming Challenge

### Problem

One common activity in our product is that a student, let's say a 3rd grader, will be presented with a brief informational or instructional video from YouTube or Vimeo. For the context of this exercise the goal of the video is to foster viewer retention of information presented. 

The student will be asked a few questions about the content designed to assess retention and encourage reflection. This helps the student validate their own understanding of the material while we measure the efficacy of the product and content in the context of the curriculum. 

### Solution

Your programming challenge is to create a minimal user experience test. 

Your program should meet the following criteria: 
* Shows a short informational or instructional video. 
  * Here’s an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRdMYuNeAng). You can use this video or one similar.
* Asks students a few questions about the video.
* Captures the student's answers and behavior (play, pause, replay, &c.)

You should produce three variants that explore different hypotheses about how to encourage students to reflect on the video they have just seen. Make sure to capture the data we’ll need to measure the relative success of each approach in your design considerations. 

We are looking for creativity in producing unique, user testable minimal solutions. 

Please keep in mind that we are not evaluating for the following: 
* Framework choice, use or utility, scaffolding 
* Data storage, retrieval or display 
* Code quality or tests 
* Polish or shine
